# surfs_up
UT Bootcamp Module 9 

## Project Overview
W. Avy is concerned about the amount of rain that the island of Oahu receives in order of possibly opening up a surf and ice cream shop.  We were given precipitation and weather stations data at the beginning of the analysis.  In end he was more concerned with specific trends in the temperature data for the months of June and December n order to determine if a surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.


## Resources
Data Sources provided to analyze and minipulate included:
- hawaii.sqlite data file

Software utilized for this study included: 
- Python 3.7.6 
- Conda 4.9.2 
- Jupyter Notebook 6.1.4
- Personal GitHub account

## Analysis and Workflow
After importing depenedencies and our Python toolkit, we reflected our data into a new model, prepared the tables and saved the reference tables as measurement and station.  We then performed the following workflow for the months of June and December:

1. Write a query that filters the Measurement table to retrieve the temperatures
2. Conver the temperatures to a list
3. Create a dataframe from the list of temperatures
4. Calculate and out the summary statistic
